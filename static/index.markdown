Itcoin (as in: **Bitcoin** without the **B**) is a permissioned Distributed Ledger (DLT) powered by the Bitcoin technology. As opposed to Bitcoin, the issuance of the token and the operation of the infrastructure is carried out by a distributed federation of trusted nodes.
Apart from these two substantial modifications, everything else is left unchanged in order to maintain compatibility with the Bitcoin protocol and to inherit and reuse all the existing ecosystem of applications that are built on top of its core infrastructure. 

* More information on the **itcoin** project is available at [our website](https://bankit.art/projects/itcoin-a-digital-currency-prototype).

## Consensus Protocol 

The itcoin blockchain uses a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm called **FBFT (Frosted Byzantine Fault Tolerance)**, which we designed using a combination of [PBFT](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf) (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) and [FROST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf) (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signatures). Being based on PBFT, our consensus algorithm is resilient to a number of Byzantine failures of nodes in the federation. Thanks to FROST, our consensus algorithm protects the federation and the quorum confidentiality. Combining Bitcoin, FROST, and PBFT turned out to be a nontrivial exercise, one that led to the following publications:

### Repositories

True to the nature of Bitcoin, we want our software be **as open as possible**; so, the following prototype implementations are made available as open source repositories:

1. [itcoin-core](https://github.com/bancaditalia/itcoin-core): contains the itcoin node implementation;
2. [secp256k1-frost](https://github.com/bancaditalia/secp256k1-frost): contains an implementation of the FROST signature scheme over *secp256k1*;
3. [itcoin-fbft](https://github.com/bancaditalia/itcoin-fbft): contains our FBFT consensus algorithm implementation.

## Payment Channel Networks

Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) promise to solve the scalability
(and privacy) issue of blockchains. Understanding them is a key
pillar to define a blockchain-based payment system that can correctly sustain a real load of payments. 

To this end, building on state of the art frameworks, we develop **itcoin-pcn-simulator**, an ecosystem for evaluating large-scale PCNs using Parallel Discrete Event Simulations (PDES).
Our solution extends the PCN simulation model proposed by [CLoTH](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2021.100717), an [open-source](https://github.com/marcono/cloth/) sequential simulator of a LN implementation widely used in recent works, and runs on [ROSS](https://ross-org.github.io/), a distributed-memory architecture PDES that can run on multiprocessor systems.

### Repositories

Our **itcoin-pcn-simulator** is available as an open source project:

* [itcoin-pcn-simulator](https://github.com/bancaditalia/itcoin-pcn-simulator/): contains our simulator of PCNs and the topology generator of Semi-Hierarchical PCNs, a special family of topologies that exploit the three-tier structure of the traditional financial system.

## Disclaimer
Itcoin is a research project by the [Applied Research Team of Bank of Italy](https://bankit.art/). It aims at academic results (publications, open source software, prototypes); it has no bearing on the official Digital Euro initiative by the Eurosystem. All the software is currently intended for testing and experimentation purposes, and not for use in a production environment.
